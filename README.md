# EPL_Prediction_Pipeline
This is my first attempt at creating a full-scale automated pipeline for EPL data: this includes, ingesting the data via API, storing the data in AWS, transforming the data/cleaning the data, and finally creating a model to predict if a team will win their next match based on the previous 5-10 results.
